## Redux - Middleware

Write middleware to achieve the following behavior:

- Display an alert "That's a great goal!" whenever a new goal is added.
- Display "Don't forget to [name of your todo item]!" whenever a new todo item is added.
Make sure that the rest of the application works as intended (you see a list of your newly added goals and todo items).
